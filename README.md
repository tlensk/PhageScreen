High-throughput Computational Method to Evaluate Potential Host Range for Bacterial Viruses

## Part I. Computing intersection matrices

### Code:
#### CompIntM.py

### Input data:
#### 10viruses.fasta

This is a multi-fasta file that contains viral sequences for the test example.

#### 10viruses_info.txt

This is a tab-delimited file that contains a brief description of viral sequences stored in 10viruses.fasta in the following format: VirusID  VirusName GenomeSize,bp

#### 7prokaryotes.fasta

This is a multi-fasta file that contains 7 prokaryote sequences for the test example.

#### 7prokaryotes_info.txt

This is a tab-delimited file that contains a brief description of the prokaryote sequences stored in 7prokaryotes.fasta in the following format: RepliconID RepliconName  RepliconSize,bp
