High-throughput Computational Method to Evaluate Potential Host Range for Bacterial Viruses

## Part I. Computing intersection matrices

### Code:
#### CompIntM.py
One can run the script on the test toy example of 10 viruses and 7 prokayotes using the following command:

python3 CompIntM.py 40 10viruses.fasta 7 prokaryotes.fasta test

Or on their data keeping the order of the input parameters as follows:
(1) screening window size
(2) multi-fasta file with viral sequences
(3) multi-fasta file with prokaryotic sequences
(4) prefix for the output files generated by the script 

The script terminates execution and throws an error message if files with the specified prefix already exist.

### Input data for a test example:
#### 10viruses.fasta

This is a multi-fasta file that contains viral sequences for the test example.

#### 10viruses_info.txt

This is a tab-delimited file that contains a brief description of viral sequences stored in 10viruses.fasta in the following format: VirusID  VirusName GenomeSize,bp

#### 7prokaryotes.fasta

This is a multi-fasta file that contains 7 prokaryote sequences for the test example.

#### 7prokaryotes_info.txt

This is a tab-delimited file that contains a brief description of the prokaryote sequences stored in 7prokaryotes.fasta in the following format: RepliconID RepliconName  RepliconSize,bp
