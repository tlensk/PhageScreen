## Part I. Computing intersection matrices

### Code:
#### CompIntM.py
One can run the script on the test toy example of 10 viruses and 7 prokayotes using the following command:

python3 CompIntM.py 40 10viruses.fasta 7 prokaryotes.fasta test

To run the script on data keeping the order of the input parameters as follows:
(1) screening window size
(2) name of a multi-fasta file with viral sequences
(3) name of a multi-fasta file with prokaryotic sequences
(4) prefix for the output files generated by the script 

The script terminates execution and throws the corresponding error message if files with the specified prefix already exist.

### Input data for a test example:
#### 10viruses.fasta

This is a multi-fasta file that contains viral sequences for the test example.

#### 10viruses_info.txt

This is a tab-delimited file that contains a brief description of viral sequences stored in 10viruses.fasta in the following format: VirusID  VirusName GenomeSize,bp

#### 7prokaryotes.fasta

This is a multi-fasta file that contains 7 prokaryote sequences for the test example.

#### 7prokaryotes_info.txt

This is a tab-delimited file that contains a brief description of the prokaryote sequences stored in 7prokaryotes.fasta in the following format: RepliconID RepliconName  RepliconSize,bp

### Results for Dataset1 and Dataset2:
These comma-separated files contain intersection matrices for the two datasets. 
Each file name includes a label for the direction of coomputing: F = forward and R = Reverse complement.
#### Dataset1_Matrix40_F.csv
#### Dataset1_Matrix40_R.csv
#### Dataset2_Matrix40_F.csv
#### Dataset2_Matrix40_R.csv

## PartII. Predicting hosts

### Code:
#### PredictHost.py
One can run the sc
### Dataset1_820phages_predict.txt

### Dataset2_1962phages_predict.txt
